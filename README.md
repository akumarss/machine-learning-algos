# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-from-Scratch

Collection of simple implementations of classic machine learning algorithms. 
This repository contains three standalone Python scripts demonstrating different approaches to supervised and recommender-system tasks. 
These are intended for learning, experimentation, and small-scale use.

## Algorithms implemented so far:
